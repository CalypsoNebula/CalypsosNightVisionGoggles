## Overview

The Robot Chicken Goggles provide advanced night vision capabilities combined with a unique ore mining reward system. When active, mining ore blocks has a chance to generate Cyber Chicken Eggs, providing an extra incentive for mining operations.

## Features

### Base Functionality
- **Night Vision**: Provides clear vision in complete darkness
- **Multiple Modes**: `ON / OFF / AUTO` switching
- **Auto Mode**: Automatically activates below light level 7
- **Energy Consumption**: 1 energy per second while active
- **Maximum Charge**: 1800 energy units
- **Rechargeable**: Uses Spider Eyes, Fermented Spider Eyes, or Glowstone Dust
- **Versatile Equipment**: Can be worn as helmet or in curios/trinket slot

### Enhanced Features
- **+2 Armor Protection**: Improved defense compared to base goggles
- **Cyber Chicken Egg Generation**: Chance to spawn eggs when mining ores

## Cyber Chicken Egg System

<Callout variant="warning">
The Robot Chicken Goggles must be active when mining ore blocks for the egg generation to trigger. Keep the goggles charged during mining sessions!
</Callout>

### How It Works
- **Trigger**: Mining any ore block while goggles are active
- **Chance-based**: Random probability to generate an egg
- **Automatic**: Eggs appear in your inventory automatically
- **No Extra Cost**: No additional energy consumed for egg generation

### Compatible Ores
The system works with blocks tagged as ores, including:
- All vanilla ores (iron, gold, diamond, coal, redstone, lapis, emerald, copper)
- Nether ores (nether gold, nether quartz, ancient debris)
- Modded ores (if properly tagged)
- Deepslate variants
- Raw ore blocks

### Cyber Chicken Eggs
- **Item**: `calypsos_nightvision_goggles:cyber_chicken_egg`
- **Use**: Robot Chicken mod integration
- **Collection**: Can be stored for later use
- **Value**: Varies based on Robot Chicken mod features

## Usage

### Equipping

## Tips & Strategies

<Callout variant="default" title="Pro Tip">
Use AUTO mode during cave mining to conserve energy while still benefiting from egg generation in dark areas where ores are most common.
</Callout>

- **Branch Mining**: Perfect for systematic ore collection in caves
- **Fortune Enchantment**: Combine with Fortune pickaxe for maximum ore yield
- **Energy Conservation**: AUTO mode works well since most ores are found in darkness
- **Ore Hunting**: Prioritize ore-rich areas like caves, ravines, and deep underground
- **Egg Collection**: Save up eggs for Robot Chicken mod features
- **Multiplayer**: Great for mining sessions where extra rewards are appreciated

## Compatibility

<Callout variant="default" title="Robot Chicken Mod Integration">
This feature works best with the **Robot Chicken** mod installed, which provides uses for the Cyber Chicken Eggs. Without it, eggs can still be collected but may have limited use.
</Callout>

- **Robot Chicken Mod**: Full integration for egg utility
- **Without Robot Chicken**: Eggs still generate but may lack functionality
- **Ore Tags**: Works with any block tagged as an ore
