## Overview

The Clockwork Goggles provide advanced night vision capabilities combined with a unique combat enhancement system. Hitting enemies builds up **Clockwork Focus**, which increases your projectile damage with each stack, making these goggles ideal for ranged combat builds.

## Features

### Base Functionality
- **Night Vision**: Provides clear vision in complete darkness
- **Multiple Modes**: `ON / OFF / AUTO` switching
- **Auto Mode**: Automatically activates below light level 7
- **Energy Consumption**: 1 energy per second while active
- **Maximum Charge**: 1800 energy units
- **Rechargeable**: Uses Spider Eyes, Fermented Spider Eyes, or Glowstone Dust
- **Versatile Equipment**: Can be worn as helmet or in curios/trinket slot

### Enhanced Features
- **+2 Armor Protection**: Improved defense compared to base goggles
- **Clockwork Focus System**: Build up stacks to increase projectile damage

## Clockwork Focus System

<Callout variant="warning">
The Clockwork Focus buff stacks up as you hit enemies, significantly increasing your projectile damage output. The effect is lost if you take damage.
</Callout>

### How It Works
- **Gain Focus**: Hit any enemy with melee or ranged attacks
- **Projectile Damage Boost**: Each stack increases damage from arrows, tridents, and other projectiles
- **Stack Building**: Focus accumulates with successful hits
- **Reset Condition**: Taking damage removes all Clockwork Focus stacks
- **Duration**: Focus persists until you take damage

### Buff Properties
- Applies to all projectile weapons (bows, crossbows, tridents, etc.)
- Damage increase scales with stack count
- Visual feedback through status effect icon
- Works with modded projectile weapons

## Crafting

<PrefabObtaining />

## Usage

### Equipping
- Place in helmet armor slot for protection and combat bonuses
- Alternatively, equip in curios/trinket slot if you have compatible mods installed

### Mode Switching
- **ON**: Continuously active night vision and Clockwork Focus system
- **OFF**: Completely disabled, conserves energy
- **AUTO**: Automatically activates in darkness (light level < 7)

### Combat Strategy

3. **Avoid Damage**: Taking any damage resets your stacks
4. **Repeat**: Continue building focus for sustained high damage
